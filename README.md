👋 Hi there, I'm Marl Kristoffer Rico!

🎓 A recent Cum Laude graduate from California State University, Fullerton with a Bachelor's in Computer Science (GPA: 3.69, Dean’s list for 6 semesters), I bring a broad set of skills in Python, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I'm proficient in Git, Visual Studio Code, Linux, Windows, Powershell, Github, XAMPP, and MySQL.

💼 Currently, I am an IT Support Analyst at SKILLED WOUND CARE in Los Angeles, CA, where I perform device setups, administer technical systems accounts, and implement robust processes for tracking and managing all hardware and software assets. I also proactively monitor servers, troubleshoot performance issues, and collaborate with fellow IT professionals to ensure system stability and security.

🌐 Prior to this, I served as an IT Student Assistant at California State University, Fullerton, overseeing asset tracking and management processes for hardware and software, delivering comprehensive IT support to students and faculty, and collaborating with the IT team to troubleshoot complex technical issues.

🎡 Additionally, I have a unique background working as a Ride Operator at both Disneyland Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood. This experience has grounded me with solid problem-solving skills, teamwork, and a knack for ensuring customer satisfaction.

🔬 I believe in continuous learning and love getting my hands dirty with real-life projects. I've led the design and development of MediMeet, a scheduling platform for medical offices, and Tuffy Aide, a versatile cross-platform application. I've also developed a comprehensive online bookstore API. My projects showcase my ability to create efficient, user-friendly solutions.

💻 I am an IT professional with a B.S. in Computer Science (Cum Laude), seeking a dynamic role to apply technical expertise and analytical skills. I am proficient in Google Workspace, Microsoft Active Directory, and Python. Eager to contribute value to your organization.
