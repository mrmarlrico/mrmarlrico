👋 Hi there, I'm Marl Kristoffer Rico!

🎓 A recent Cum Laude graduate from California State University, Fullerton with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, I bring a broad set of skills in Python, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I'm proficient in Git, Visual Studio Code, Linux, Windows, Powershell, Github, XAMPP, and MySQL.

💻 Currently serving as an IT Student Assistant at CSUF, I've honed my skills in hardware and software asset management and IT support.

🎡 Prior to that, I had a unique journey working as a ride operator at both Disneyland Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood. This experience has grounded me with solid problem-solving skills, teamwork, and a knack for ensuring customer satisfaction.

🔬 I believe in continuous learning and love getting my hands dirty with real-life projects. I've led the design and development of MediMeet, a scheduling platform for medical offices and Tuffy Aide, a versatile cross-platform application, and developed a comprehensive online bookstore API. My projects showcase my ability to create efficient, user-friendly solutions.

🌐 I'm eager to contribute to more open-source projects and collaborate with other developers. If you have a project I might be interested in, feel free to reach out!
